jsdoc
=====
After total dataloss i have to rewrite the Readme's and Test's, so please be patient.
jsdoc is currently **not a bit** stable. Stay tuned. {doc:CONCEPT#Function} oder {doc:CONCEPT.README}

For some more information about the architecture see:

  - {Core Kern}  
  - {CodeObject}
  - {Token}
  - {Dom}  
  - {Renderer}
  
The 'executable' is {JsDoc}
